Explain ticket intake IRL:
Sometimes tickets get created via phone, chat app, email, web form, or maybe even you run into someone in your hall or they roll up on you at your desk.
A lot of the time people will randomize you and try to get you to fix stuff on the spot. It’s fine to fix things on the spot, but generally speaking, you want to create tickets for EVERYTHING you do. (metrics are important)
